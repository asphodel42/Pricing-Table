# Pricing-Table

It's small pricing table project which you can take to yours,  change as you want, modify etc.

This columns has responsive design, which scales with size of a screen.
For tablets and mobile devices with width of screen < 650 i used a media query, that places table in one column.

The goal was in studying interests but it looks pretty good, let me know what you think.
